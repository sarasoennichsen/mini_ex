My program is based off of an example of flocking on the p5.js website. I've used rules of cohesion, alignment and seperation that dictates the movement of ellipses.

When considering generative art from a point of view where it's made to be enjoyable and aestheticly pleasing, one of the concepts that I found most interesting is autonomous systems. This is expressed in my program also, as it starts off as soon as you open it and from then on it's only the preset rules that will dictate the development - it can't be changed by moving the mouse, pressing a key etc.
Although I did consider using an interactive aspect in my program and write a bit about the program as a representation of a social situation, where certain 'social rules' (the preset rules) dictate the progression of the situation but an unforeseen/unexpected 'event' (interactive aspect) could impact the progression, but I didn't have time to do this.
