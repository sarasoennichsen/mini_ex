- My initial thought was that this should be a program that displayed the prologue from Romeo & Juliet, and then when clicking a button it would change. The overall format and some of the words would be the same as before, but other words would change - the prologue would be changed and not carry the same meaning as the original Romeo & Juliet prologue, but you would still recognize it as originated from that prologue.
- That didn't happen. At first when I had started programming this, I realized after some time that I actually didn't implement the RiTa library at all, so I backtracked and tried again. I've now used RiTa library for making the program that you see, but obviously it has some errors (and it's not the intentional kind). My program is displaying the prologue from Romeo & Juliet along with a button saying 'click me'. When clicking the button, I wanted the use the 'similarbySoundandLetter' function, so that it created a new text that sort of looked and sounded like the original prologue, but wasn't. I couldn't get that to work though, so instead I tried to switch out all the nouns with a random word from the RiTa lexicon. The problem is that this new text is displayed beneath my canvas and the original prologue.

Give a title to your piece and describe your program with a screenshot.
What kind of functions you have used from RiTa library?
Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials?
How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text?
