- My initial thought was that this should be a program that displayed the prologue from Romeo & Juliet, and then when clicking a button it would change. The overall format and some of the words would be the same as before, but other words would change - the prologue would be changed and not carry the same meaning as the original Romeo & Juliet prologue, but you would still recognize it as originated from that original prologue.
- Obviously that didn't happen.


Give a title to your piece and describe your program with a screenshot.
What kind of functions you have used from RiTa library?
Can you describe your experience in working with found text as the source materials?
How might we think about the materiality of text/interface? How might we understand the “textual character” of the found text?
