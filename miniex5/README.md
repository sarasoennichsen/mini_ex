- My initial thought was that this should be a program that displayed the prologue from Romeo & Juliet, and then when clicking a button it would change. The overall format and some of the words would be the same as before, but other words would change - the prologue would be changed and not carry the same meaning as the original Romeo & Juliet prologue, but you would still recognize it as originated from that prologue.
- At first when I had started programming this, I realized after some time that I actually didn't implement the RiTa library at all, so I backtracked and tried again. I've now used RiTa library for making the program that you see, but obviously it has some errors (and it's not the intentional kind). My program is displaying the prologue from Romeo & Juliet along with a button saying 'click me'. When clicking the button, I wanted the use 'similarbySoundandLetter', so that it created a new text that sort of looked and sounded like the original prologue, but wasn't. I couldn't get that to work though, so instead I tried to switch out all the nouns with a random word from the RiTa lexicon, as shown in the example from peer-tutoring this week. The problem is that this new text is displayed beneath my canvas and the original prologue.
- Even though it has been quite hard to figure out a whole new library, I've also found it funny and inspiring to work with found text as the source material. It gives you a lot of new options and I find the many 'layers' of it interesting (there's both that whole thing about the medium, there's the text itself, the user as reader/author etc.)
