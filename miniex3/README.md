<i>Describe a bit about your throbber design (your concept and execution)</i>
Initially I wanted to make a 'cute' throbber to keep whoever watching entertained. As I began coding it, it appeared quite boring to me though, so I decided to try and take another approach. After our tuesday lecture I'd tried and failed at loading an image or a gif, so I decided that I would figure it out and use it when coding my redesign of a throbber. My throbber code turned out quite simple; the background image trying to symbolize the underlying processes happening while users are only showed a throbber.

<i>How may we use programming to reflect and inquire digital (visual) culture?</i>
Programming may be used as a tool to alter views on/understanding of digital culture. As I've tried to communicate with my redesigned throbber, programming is often "invisible" to the "normal, unknowing" user, but it doesn't have to be.
